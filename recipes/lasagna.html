    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a popular Italian dish that consists of layers of pasta, meat sauce, and cheese. It is a baked casserole-style dish that is typically rectangular in shape. The traditional version of lasagna includes wide, flat pasta sheets that are layered with a rich tomato-based meat sauce, such as Bolognese, along with various types of cheese, typically mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta. The layers are stacked on top of each other, creating a hearty and flavorful combination.

        Lasagna is known for its versatility, as it can be customized with different ingredients to suit personal preferences. Along with the meat sauce, additional layers can include vegetables like spinach or mushrooms, and sometimes even seafood or alternative meat options for vegetarian or vegan versions. The dish is often seasoned with herbs and spices like oregano and basil to enhance the flavors.
